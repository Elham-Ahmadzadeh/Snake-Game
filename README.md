# Snake-Game
Pure JavaScript, HTML and css Snake Game
Move the snake around with arrow keys on the computer or the button keys on mobile phones, eat the red dots to grow bigger
and earn scores. Avoid hitting your tail. You can restart the game by restart button and see the time.

I put external javascript files on jsFunctions folder in order to classify the  JS files and make them easier to find. the main js file with the name of app.js is located inside js folder.
